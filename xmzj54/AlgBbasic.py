############ YOUR CODE SHOULD NOW BE COMPLETE AND WHEN EXECUTION OF THIS PROGRAM 'skeleton.py'
############ REACHES THIS POINT, YOU SHOULD HAVE COMPUTED A TOUR IN THE RESERVED LIST VARIABLE 'tour', 
############ WHICH HOLDS A LIST OF THE INTEGERS FROM {0, 1, ..., 'num_cities' - 1} SO THAT EVERY INTEGER
############ APPEARS EXACTLY ONCE, AND YOU SHOULD ALSO HOLD THE LENGTH OF THIS TOUR IN THE RESERVED
############ INTEGER VARIABLE 'tour_length'.
############
############ YOUR TOUR WILL BE PACKAGED IN A TOUR FILE OF THE APPROPRIATE FORMAT AND THIS TOUR FILE'S
############ NAME WILL BE A MIX OF THE NAME OF THE CITY FILE, THE NAME OF THIS PROGRAM AND THE
############ CURRENT DATE AND TIME. SO, EVERY SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION GIVES A TOUR FILE WITH A UNIQUE
############ NAME AND YOU CAN RENAME THE ONES YOU WANT TO KEEP LATER.
############
############ DO NOT EDIT ANY TOUR FILE! ALL TOUR FILES MUST BE LEFT AS THEY WERE ON OUTPUT.
############
############ DO NOT TOUCH OR ALTER THE CODE BELOW THIS POINT! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
